# Jetson Car
The Jetson car was the first platform I used to study control systems and computer vision. It is
the first robotics project of mine to implement the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as an onboard
processor; however, it still uses an Arduino microcontroller to send motor signals.
The Jetson car started as a robot drivetrain and has turned into a project to develop an
autonomous ground robot. I designed the Jetson car to learn about different control
algorithms, specifically linear-quadratic regulators (LQR),  and how I could use cameras as a
sensor. Along with this, part of the motivation for this project was to learn how to use the
NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform as an onboard processor to increase the computational ability of
a robot beyond simple microcontrollers.
I have used what I learned from this project thus far to implement similar strategies in other
robotics projects. The objective of the Jetson car was to learn how to implement an LQR
controller for path following on a ground robot. By doing so, I would better understand LQR
control and how to implement them in other applications.
